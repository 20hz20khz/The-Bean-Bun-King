It was a dark and stormy night, when the Bean Bun King woke up and found that his precious slices were gone. "Nooooooo!" he screamed. He could not make the perfect sandwich,
so he improvised. He decided make a pizza sandwich. It was a sandwich so perfect that encompassed the perfection of pizza in the form of a sandwich. The kingdom  imploded with joy.
Only the most GLORIOUS king could be capable of such genius. Only the most PERFECT king could put pizza on a bun. Little did they know, that he had not come up with this idea himself.
The last man to question the king had been sentenced to life on Reddit. No one dared to downvote his comments or questions his authority after that. Not even the kingdom's biggest redditors thought of such a thing. So, the king's secret was safe. This was until one fateful day, when he created the stupidest post in the history of the board. The board admins were powerless against the evil power of the post.
